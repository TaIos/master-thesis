\section{Layout construction}\label{sec:layout-construction}

Solution to the painting placement problem is a set of placement points for the paintings.
There are multiple steps that transform the individual to these points.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Decoding random keys and orientation probabilities.
    \item Slicing tree construction.
    \item Placement heuristic.
\end{enumerate}

In this section, the first two are described â€“ decoding and slicing tree construction.
Last one, placement heuristic, is described in Chapter~\ref{TODO}.

\subsection{Individual decoding}\label{subsec:individual-decoding}
Goal of individual decoding is to transforms its representation to a different one,
which can be used to construct a slicing tree.
