\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
This section presents a painting placement solution to the painting placement instances described in table~\ref{tab:instances}.
Solutions to the random scenario instances are in subsection~\ref{subsec:random-scenario},
packing scenarios in subsection~\ref{subsec:packing-scenario}, and clustering scenarios in subsection~\ref{subsec:clustering-scenario}.
Hyperparameter values used to obtain results in this section are in table~\ref{tab:hyperparameters-values}.
Statistics for each instance are in table~\ref{tab:statistics}.

Hyperparameter values in table~\ref{tab:hyperparameters-values} are set to their recommended values
from hyperparameter testing in section~\ref{sec:hyper-parameters}.
The hyperparameter not set to the recommended values is \verb|maxNumberOfIter|.
It is set to 500 instead of a value from the recommended range \numrange{100}{150}.
The reason is to possibly find a better painting placement solution in exchange for more computation time.

The recommendation to remove orientation penalization by setting \verb|orientationWeights| to $\langle 1,1,1\rangle$ is followed.
As described in hyperparameter testing, it should produce a population with a better on-average objective and a faster-decreasing trend in objective value.
Also, the population size is set to 75 times the instance size.
It is the midpoint of the recommended interval \numrange{50}{100}.
Lastly, population division is set to the same values in listing~\ref{lst:computation-submission-dataset}.
It means keeping an elitism strategy and injecting random individuals into the reproductive plan.

\subsection{Random scenario}\label{subsec:random-scenario}

Visualization of the painting placement solution to the random\_10 instance
is in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-random-10}
and for random\_20 instance in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-random-20}.

For the random\_10 instance, we can see that there are no overlappings, and only painting 6 is placed outside the layout.
Also, due to the eval function $\pi$ (eq~\ref{eq:objective}) set to
$f(x,y) = x+y$, we can see that smaller paintings
are placed towards the bottom left corner.

For the random\_20 instance, we can see that there are four overlappings.
Similarly to the random\_10 instance, the eval function forced the placement of the
smaller paintings to the bottom left corner.
Only one painting is placed outside the layout.
However, there are 4 overlapping pairs.
It might suggest further increasing the penalization constant $\lambda$.

\subsection{Packing scenario}\label{subsec:packing-scenario}
Visualization of the painting placement solution to the packing\_10 instance
is in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-packing-10}
and for packing\_20 instance in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-packing-20}.
Packing scenario differs from the random one in layout area ratio (subsec~\ref{subsec:generation-parameters}).
Packing has this ratio set to one, which means that the area of the layout equals the area of all paintings summed together.

For the packing\_10 instance, we can see no overlappings and paintings 2,3 and 4 placed outside the layout.
However, this solution might still be packed even more, for example, by moving paintings 1 and 2 down.
It could be achieved using a post-optimization, suggested in subsection~ ef {subsec:post-optimization}.

For the packing\_20 instance, we can see seven overlappings pairs.
Similarly to the random\_20 instance, it might suggest increasing the overlapping penalization constant $\lambda$.

\subsection{Clustering scenario}\label{subsec:clustering-scenario}

Two clustering instances are tested, with visualization for cluster\_3\_6 instance
in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-cluster-3-6} and for cluster\_4\_5 instance in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-cluster-4-5}.
The clustering scenario tested the ability to place paintings inside clusters.
Clusters are defined using a flow between paintings, which is set to 0 between paintings from different
clusters and nonzero to the paintings from the same clusters.
Visualization of the flow for cluster\_3\_6 instance is in the appendix on the right of the figure~\ref{fig:instance-flow}.

For the cluster\_3\_6 instance, we can see the successful formation of clusters.
However, seven overlapping pairs exist, exclusively between paintings in the same cluster.
It might suggest that the flow is too high or that the overlapping penalization constant $\lambda$ is too low.


For the cluster\_4\_5 instance, we can see a partially successful formation of clusters.
It might be caused by the increased complexity as there are four clusters instead of three for the cluster\_3\_6 instance.
We can see overlappings between the paintings from the same cluster and even between clusters.
The same suggestion as for the cluster\_3\_6 instance might be given – the flow is set too high or that the overlapping penalization constant $\lambda$ is set too low.

\subsection{London Gallery Wall}\label{subsec:london-gallery-wall}

The last tested instance is london\_gallery\_wall.
It represents the painting placement at the London National Gallery from figure~\ref{fig:london-wall}.

Visualization of the result is in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-london-gallery-wall}.
We can see no overlappings, and two paintings are placed outside the wall.

The proposed solution can reconstruct the interactions between paintings using the flow.
It means that the paintings that are placed close together in the London National Gallery from figure~\ref{fig:london-wall}
are also placed together in the visualization of the painting placement solution in figure~\ref{fig:results:visualization-london-gallery-wall}.
Concrete flow values that are used are in the attached medium.
