\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

This section presents the testing results of the proposed solution.
First, hyper-parameters are tested in order to determine their reasonable values in subsection~\ref{subsec:hyper-parameters}.
Next, using these values, the results of performance tests are presented subsection~\ref{subsec:performance}.
Lastly, the best-obtained solutions are visualized in the section~\ref{subsec:visualization}.

\subsection{Hyper-parameters}\label{subsec:hyper-parameters}

\subsubsection*{Population size}

Population size is tested in order to determine a reasonable value called \textit{population scaling factor}.
This value determines the size of the population with respect to the instance size.
Thus, for instance, with size $N$ and scaling factor $k$, population size is determined as
$k \times N$.
This means that the population size is linear with respect to the instance size.

Results for two random instances can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:pop-size}.
From it, we can deduce that scaling factor $10$ does not allow
the population objective average to decrease to the levels comparable to scaling factors $50$ and $100$.
This might imply that the scaling factor $10$ is insufficient to represent knowledge gathered over time
in the genetic approach.
Also, researches in~\cite{goncalvesBiasedRandomkeyGenetic2015} solving UA-FLP using BRKGA
similarly obtained their best results for scaling factor $100$.

The conclusion is that using scaling factor between $50$ and $100$ is sufficient, with bias towards $100$
for obtaining better average objective performance.
However, increasing the scaling factor leads to slower computation speed as every population contains
more individuals for which genetic operators and reproductive plan must be computed.
