\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

This section presents results of testing the proposed solution.
First, two hyper-parameters are tested in order to determine their reasonable values in subsection~\ref{subsec:hyper-parameters}.
They are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Population size
    \item Overlapping penalization constant
\end{itemize}

Next, using these values, performance tests are conducted in subsection~\ref{subsec:performance}.
