\chapter{Computational results}\label{ch:computational-results}

This chapter presents the computational results of the proposed solution,
generated datasets, hyperparameters,
and implementation of the computation server
to which a user can submit a painting placement instance
and receive a solution to that instance.
Discussion of the obtained results follows in the next chapter~\ref{ch:discussion}.

First, four testing scenarios used for evaluation are described in
section~\ref{sec:scenarios}.
They are random, clustering, packing, and London National Gallery.
Next, in section~\ref{sec:dataset}, datasets created for each testing scenario are described.
Then, section~\ref{sec:hyper-parameters} describes and discusses
the hyperparameters of the proposed genetic algorithm~\ref{alg:genetic}.
Section~\ref{sec:results} contains measurement graphs and datasets visualization.
Lastly, section~\ref{sec:implementation} presents the implementation of the computation server.
