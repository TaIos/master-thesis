\chapter{Computational results}\label{ch:computational-results}

This chapter presents the computational results of the proposed solution,
generated dataset, hyperparameters of the genetic algorithm,
and implementation of the computation server
to which a user can submit a painting placement instance and receive a solution to that instance.

First, four testing scenarios used for evaluation are described in
section~\ref{sec:scenarios}.
They are random, clustering, packing, and London National Gallery.
Next, in section~\ref{sec:dataset}, the dataset created for each testing scenario is described.
Then, section~\ref{sec:hyper-parameters} describes and discusses
the hyperparameters of the proposed genetic algorithm~\ref{alg:genetic}.
Also, reasonable hyperparameter values are determined.
Section~\ref{sec:results} presents a painting placement solutions to the painting placement instances and their visualizations.
Lastly, section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes the implementation of the computation server.
