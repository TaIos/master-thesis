\chapter{Coding and solution construction}\label{ch:coding-and-solution-construction}

This chapter is the central part of the thesis.
It presents the novel genetic approach demonstrated in solving the painting placement problem.
In section~\ref{sec:genetics}, definitions regarding genetics are laid out together with the Schema Theorem description.
Section~\ref{sec:coding} describing individual representation and section~\ref{sec:operators}
describing genetic operators together present the novel genetic approach.
Section~\ref{sec:solution-construction} describes how to decode an individual and construct a painting placement solution.
Lastly, section~\ref{sec:genetic-algorithm} describes the genetic algorithm.
