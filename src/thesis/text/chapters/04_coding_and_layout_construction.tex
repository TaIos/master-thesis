\chapter{Coding and layout construction}\label{ch:coding-and-layout-construction}

This chapter is the central part of the thesis
as it presents the novel genetic approach, which is demonstrated in solving the painting placement problem.
In section~\ref{sec:genetics}, definitions regarding genetics are laid out together with the Schema Theorem description.
Section~\ref{sec:coding} describing individual representation and section~\ref{sec:operators}
describing genetic operators together present the novel genetic approach.
Section~\ref{sec:reproductive-plan} describes the reproductive plan.
Lastly, section~\ref{sec:layout-construction} describes a greedy placing heuristic
used to construct the painting placement layout.
