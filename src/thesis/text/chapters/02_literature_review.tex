\chapter{Literature review}\label{ch:literature-review}

This chapter describes methods used in different fields to solve a similar problem to the
painting placement. It follows the methods mentioned in previous chapter~\ref{ch:introduction} with
a more precise and in-depth explanation.

The main difference in all methods is their domain, which determines the objective function, i.e.,
the measure by which different solutions can be compared.
Also, there are differences between the given constraints, as some of them are more loose or strict,
depending on the intended use of the result.

Discussion of 3 methods follows â€“ facility layout problem in~\ref{sec:facility-layout-problem},
shelf space planning in~\ref{sec:shelf-space-planning} and sheet metal cutting in~\ref{sec:sheet-metal-cutting}.
