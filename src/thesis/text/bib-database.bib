  abstract = {This paper addresses a fundamental short-run resource-allocation problem confronting retail distribution: simultaneously finding the specific brands, from many, that should be displayed, and the amount of retail product-display area that should be assigned to these brands, in order to maximize the retail institution's profit. The paper decomposes total market demand according to the various levels of brand preference that could conceivably exist in final markets, and then, employs an algorithm, similar to the one used to solve the fixed-charge problem, to find the optimal brand mix and display-area allocation.},

  abstract = {The facility layout problem is a typical combinational optimization problem. In this research, a slicing tree representation and a quadratically constrained program model are combined with harmony search to develop a heuristic method for solving the unequal-area block layout problem. Because of characteristics of slicing tree structure, we propose a regional structure of harmony memory to memorize facility layout solutions and two kinds of harmony improvisation to enhance global search ability of the proposed heuristic method. The proposed harmony search based heuristic is tested on 10 well-known unequal-area facility layout problems from the literature. The results are compared with the previously best-known solutions obtained by genetic algorithm, tabu search, and ant system as well as exact methods. For problems O7, O9, vC10Ra, M11*, and Nug12, new best solutions are found. For other problems, the proposed approach can find solutions that are very similar to previous best-known solutions.},

This study aims at proposing some techniques to tackle the premature convergence by controlling the population diversity. Firstly, a sexual selection mechanism which utilizes the mate chromosome during selection is used. The second technique focuses on controlling the genetic parameters by applying the fuzzy logic controller. Computational experiments are conducted on the proposed techniques and the results are compared with other genetic operators, heuristics, and local search algorithms commonly used for solving multidimensional 0/1 knapsack problems published in the literature.},
